# ***🚀🐙 Rootkits Development Starter Pack***

This folder previously contained learning material, notes, and introductory examples related to Windows kernel-mode rootkit development. To keep Benthic clean, all beginner-friendly content has been moved to a dedicated repository:

📌 **[TheMalwareGuardian: Rootkits Development Starter Pack](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Rootkits-Development-Starter-Pack)**

If you're new to kernel development, DKOM, WFP, WSK, minifilter drivers, or want to build your first kernel-mode project and manually configure your environment, the Starter Pack will guide you through the fundamentals.

This folder remains here only as a placeholder for internal references within the Benthic project.
